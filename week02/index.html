                <p>JavaScript has a special operator called typeof for finding out the type of a value.
                    Here are some examples of the different value types:<br>

                    typeof 'hello'<< 'string' <br> typeof 10<< 'number' <br>typeof true<< 'boolean' <br>typeof {
                                ninja: 'turtle' }<< 'object' <br>typeof [ 1, 2, 3 ]<< 'object' <br>(All non-primitive

                                        refresher Arrow
                                        Functions ES6 introduced a new syntax for declaring functions called the arrow
                                        syntax. These
                                        make declaring functions much more succinct by using less verbose syntax. Arrow
                                        functions
                                        can be identified by the 'arrow' symbol,=> that gives them their name. The
                                        parameters come
                                        before the arrow and the main body of
                                        the function comes after. Arrow functions are always anonymous, so if you want
                                        to refer to
                                        them,
                                        you must assign them to a variable. For example, the square function we wrote
                                        earlier can be
                                        written like so:
                                        Copy
                                        const square = x => x*x;

                                        Arrow functions make perfect candidates for short, anonymous functions, and you
                                        will often
                                        see
                                        them used later in the book.</p>
